# Programming Languages Learning Repository

This repository contains code examples and exercises that I wrote while learning various programming languages. The goal of this repository is **to demonstrate my understanding of the basics of each language**.  

## Contents

Each folder corresponds to a programming language and contains multiple scripts that illustrate my learning process:

- **Python** – Basic syntax, data structures, functions, and common operations.  
- **Bash** – Shell scripting for command-line tasks and automation.  
- **C** – Core concepts, control structures, and simple programs.  
- **C++** – Basic syntax, functions, and standard input/output.  
- **Matlab** – Scripts for mathematical computations, plotting, and simple algorithms.  
- **R** – Data analysis, visualization, and basic statistical programming.  
- **Java** – Basic syntax, control structures, and functions.  

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **personal learning archive**, demonstrating my progression in understanding the syntax and principles of each language. The scripts are educational and small-scale, designed for practice and learning.  

## Usage

Explore each folder to see examples in each language. These scripts can be used as learning references or practice material.
